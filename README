File::Fingerprint::Huge is designed to quickly finger print very large files.
The idea here is to only read segments of the files rather than the entire file.

This allows us to quickly generate finger prints even with slow I/O. 

Finger prints are not guaranteed to be unique, however your chances of not
having unique finger prints are billions to one.

This module requires Digest::CRC with functional crc64() routine as well
as Math::Random::MT to function properly.
